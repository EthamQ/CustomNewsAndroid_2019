Description taken from the app store:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The goal of this app
To show you only the news YOU like, determined by YOU!

How do I say what I like?
You can swipe news to the left or right to indicate whether or not you like them.
Sometimes you will also be asked questions to tell which topics are interesting for you.
Also answer them by swiping.

What happens after I liked something?
We save every category and topic you liked.
You can look them up in the "My Statistics" menu.
Step by step we will show you more of the news you like and every day you will get 
one news article for every topic you liked in the "News of the day" menu.

Which languages are supported?
You can get news in either russian, french, english or german.
You can even select multiple languages at once.

Known issues:
Everything works except for one last issue I didn't have time for yet.
After some days the News of the day aren't automatically updated anymore.
But at some point i will still fix this.
