        For now yes, however&#8230;
        as long as I offer it for free (unless i show ads which I don\'t want to)
        there are some limitations to its use.
    </string>
    <string name="finance_info_text2">
        I use a third party api to request the news.
        I can only show a preview of the content of a news article and not the entire text.
        Furthermore the amount of news I can request per day is limited.
        So if there are more users it is possible that this limit is reached and you can\'t
        load new articles anymore for a certain amount of time.
    </string>
    <string name="finance_info_text3">
        I would have to pay 450$ per month to get rid of those limitations which i can\'t afford.
        So I would be happy if you supported the app with a really small amount per month if you want to help me
        offering a full version of this app. (More in the settings menu)
