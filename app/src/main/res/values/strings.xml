        <b>Yes</b> I want to keep this app for free but
        as long as I offer it for free (unless i show ads which I don\'t want to)
        there are some <b>limitations</b> to its use.
    </string>
    <string name="finance_info_text2">
        I use a third party api to request the news.
        I can only show a <b>preview of the content</b> of a news article and not the entire text.
        Furthermore the amount of news I can request per day is <b>limited</b>.
        So if there are more users it is possible that this limit is reached and you can\'t
        load new articles anymore for a certain amount of time.
    </string>
    <string name="finance_info_text3">
        I would have to pay <b>450$ per month</b> to get rid of those limitations which i can\'t afford.
        So I would be happy if you <b>supported the app</b> with a really small amount per month if you want to help me
        offer a <b>full version</b> of this app. (You can support it in the <b>Settings menu</b>)
