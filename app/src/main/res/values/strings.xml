        When you go to home you can see a card which shows you a news article.
        You can also click on the article to get to the entire article.
        If you\'re interested in the article you can swipe the article to the right,
        if not swipe it to the left.
        This app will remember what kind of topics you\'re interested in and show
        you more articles related to that topic.
        If you want to know what kind of requestResponse the app collects about you just go to
        My Statistics.

    <string name="known_problems_text">
        I\'m just a small developer and I use a free source for the news articles I\'m showing to you.
        That\'s why I can request news articles only up to 1000 times a month.
        Furthermore I don\'t get the entire article content, that\'s why I link to
        the entire article.
        So for now the usage of this app is limited but if I\'m able to generate any kind of revenue
        with this app I\'ll be able to pay for an upgrade of my news source.

        For now yes, however...
        as long as I offer it for free (unless i show ads which I don\'t want to) there are some limitations to its use.
    </string>

    <string name="finance_info_text2">
        I use a third party api to request the news.
        I can only show a preview of the content of a news article and not the entire text.
        Furthermore the amount of news I can request per day is limited.
        So if there are more users it is possible that this limit is reached and you can\'t
        load new articles anymore for a certain amount of time.
    </string>

    <string name="finance_info_text3">
        I would have to pay 450$ per month to get rid of those limitations which i can\'t afford.
        So I would be happy if you supported the app with a really small amount per month if you want to help me
        offering a full version of this app. (More in the settings menu)
